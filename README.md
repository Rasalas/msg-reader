# msgReader

![alt text](doc/res/msg-reader-screenshot.png)

My collegue sends me a lot of emails in the *.msg format. It's the format that "Old Microsoft Outlook" uses if you export an email or attach it to another email.  
I couldn't even open these files on my Windows 11 machine, because of an error that stated that I need an active Microsoft 365 subscription - which is confusing (or **very** wrong), because I have one and it's active in all other MS Office apps.

Since my collegue doesn't stop sending me these <3 and my Feedback to Microsoft a few months ago didn't do anything ðŸ’¤, I decided to take matters into my own hands.  
I wrote a small tool that can read these files and show them to me (about) how they are shown in email clients - with HTML and inline images and all.

I am currently writing with the Microsoft Support to get this issue fixed, but until then, I have this tool (and everyone who needs to open *.msg files and can't/wont afford a Microsoft 365 Subscription to open a fricking .msg-File).  

... also - WHY would you put a paywall in front of a file format that you created?

## Features
- Open and read *.msg and *.eml files directly in your browser or desktop application
- View HTML content and inline images
- Pin important messages
- Multiple file support with message list
- Sort messages by date
- Drag & drop support

## Project Structure
The project is organized into several modules:
- `MessageHandler.js` - Manages message state and storage
- `UIManager.js` - Handles UI updates and rendering
- `FileHandler.js` - Manages file operations and drag & drop
- `utils.js` - Contains MSG file processing and utility functions
- `main.js` - Initializes and orchestrates the application
- `desktop/` - Contains the desktop application built with Wails and Go

## HYPER Quick Start (GitHub Pages)
1. Open [rasalas.github.io/msg-reader/](https://rasalas.github.io/msg-reader/)
2. Drag your file from your file system and drop it in the drop area.
3. Done.  

You should now see your email contents

## Quick Start (locally)
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rasalas/msg-reader.git
cd msg-reader
```

2. Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the application
```bash
npm start
```
A browser window should open with the application running.

## Desktop Application
The project now includes a desktop application built with Wails and Go. This allows you to run the application as a native desktop application on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### Prerequisites
To build the desktop application, you need:
- Go 1.21 or later
- Wails CLI
- Platform-specific dependencies for Wails

### Installing Wails
Run the installation script:
```bash
cd desktop
./install-wails.sh
```

### Development
To start the development server for the desktop application:
```bash
cd desktop
./dev.sh
```

### Building
To build the desktop application:
```bash
cd desktop
./build.sh
```

The built application will be in the `desktop/build/bin` directory.

## Development (Web)
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rasalas/msg-reader.git
cd msg-reader
```

2. Install the dependencies
```bash
npm install 
```

3. Run the application in development mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

A browser window should open with the application running. The application will automatically reload when changes are made to the source code.

## Build Process
The application uses browserify to bundle the JavaScript modules and tailwindcss for styling.

### Build Commands
- `npm run build` - Builds both JavaScript and CSS
- `npm run build:js` - Bundles JavaScript modules
- `npm run build:css` - Compiles Tailwind CSS
- `npm run watch` - Watches for changes and rebuilds
- `npm run dev` - Runs development server with live reload
- `npm run deploy` - Deploys to GitHub Pages

For the desktop application, use the scripts in the `desktop` directory:
- `./desktop/dev.sh` - Starts the Wails development server
- `./desktop/build.sh` - Builds the Wails desktop application

Java app. Works, basically my favourite, but doesn't show inline images

[encryptomatic.com | Free Online .msg Viewer](https://www.encryptomatic.com/viewer/)  
Kinda sus. I don't really trust them, because they sell the ~same thing as a [product](https://www.encryptomatic.com/msgviewer/msgviewerpro.html). You also can't see inline images and you get an ad in the end of the email instad of in the page itself.

[GitHub | datenteiler/ReadMsgFile](https://github.com/datenteiler/ReadMsgFile)  
Seems to be ok, but it only shows the text version of the email. No inline images or HTML because it uses a command line interface.

Costst money and doesn't look promising.
